This report contains the results of an analysis of test data assessing the correctness of performance of a weighlifting exercise, as measured by accelerometers attached on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. The purpose was to establish whether the perfomance of an exercise in a particular way could be correctly interpreted on the basis of sensor data collected, and used for prediction.

The data was analyzed using several models and a gradient boosting machine (GBM) model was selected for its efficiency and predictive power. The model successfully predicted all the variables in the test set provided.
